# altschoolSecondSemesterExamProject
# So I worked on the project to the point of installing mysql and configuring my postgresql using bash script
# But unfortunately I used the terminal of my Ubuntu VM 
# I was unable to push my progress to this github repo as password authentication was not possible
# I tried creating a personal access token but that proved futile as well even after numerouse attempts 
# I tried to push the file from my VirtualBox in my desktop but that was too large a file as well
# I tried AWS and digital ocean but had issues gaining access to their services due to unauthentication of my card
# With all looking hopeless and me desperate not to lose this amazing opportuntiy
# I took a snapshot of my progress from installing apache2, php, composer, and mysql.
# I also took a snapshot of the running ansible playbook installation
# I had to do this as it seems like my last resort
# This is no way near good enough but hopefully my work can count for something as I am terribly stressed
# Thank you!
